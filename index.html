                Wonderbloom was the first nature-based preschool to be established in Salt Lake City, UT. They were inspired by the philosophy of European "Forest Schools," where children learn away from screens and in a more natural environment.

        I identified that our users would be mostly parents - whether they are looking for a preschool or already have their child enrolled with Wonderbloom. So the 3 user interviews done were with parents. These parents and users needed a better way to find the information that is most important, such as tuition prices, schedules and signing up for newsletters.

    After a heuristic evaluation, it was determined that the Wonderbloom website could be improved with better color usability for accessibility and just overall visual appeal as well as a better navigation and a more standardized font and alignment across the pages and information. The card sorting method was used to organize the navigation into a more intuitive order with four new sections leading to a new sitemap & user flow.

    <div class="userIntro">
        This non profit website has so much potential still even after the redesign. If the project were to continue, next steps could be to implement a new app for users. Wonderbloom is pushing the envelope of what we know preschools to be, so it would be incredible bringing them into the spotlight as they deserve.
